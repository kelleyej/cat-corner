## Context 
- Goals:
  - Create a web application utilizing a new-to-me tech stack, including Svelte, SvelteKit, and Tailwind CSS. 
- Wins:
  - Successfully implemented the OpenAI API to create a question box dedicated to allowing users to ask questions specifically related to cats.
  - Used pagination to minimize overwhelming the user with all 67 breeds of cats populating on the homepage. 

## Future Improvements 
- The Cat API offers more information pertaining to each breed. I could consider adding additional detail to each card.
